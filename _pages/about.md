Hi! I'm an MIT alum with degrees in Physics and in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Right now I'm working at the Harvard-Smithsonian CfA on using state-of-the-art scientific computing libraries to develop efficient parallel scalable algorithms for fitting geometric models to black hole data captured by the Event Horizon Telescope.

Perhaps at some point in the future I'll flesh out this page with more exciting stuff I'm working on!
